<h1>Devin Hendrick Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1>

<h2>First, the basics.</h2>

You need the following to build your website.

<ul>
    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
   <li>Javascript</li> 
   <li>Node.js</li> 
</ul>


You should list your top 5 albums below.

<ol>
   <li>Heaven or Hell by Don Toliver</li> 
    <li>Astroworld by Travis Scott</li>
   <li>Sremmlife 2 by Rae Sremmurd</li> 
   <li>Life of a DON by Don Toliver</li> 
   <li>Legends Never Die by Juice WRLD</li> 
</ol>


<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>

<p>Sometimes you want to <strong><em>do both.</strong></em></p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br>
     Neither can image tags, or hard lines.<br>
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.<hr></p>

<h2>Images </h2>
<p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

<img src="./images/mochi.jpg" alt="jpg"> 
<img src="./images/mochi.png" alt="png"> 
<img src="./images/mochi.svg" alt="svg"> 
<img src="./images/mochi.gif" alt="gif">

If you want your repo to be private, be sure to invite Prof A as a "collaborator."</p>
